## Implementation Notes

1. **JWT Token**: Include user role in JWT payload
2. **Route Guards**: Use `@Roles()` decorator on endpoints
3. **Data Filtering**: Service layer filters data based on user role
4. **Approval Workflow**: Implement amount-based approval routing
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all role-based access attempts
6. **Dynamic Permissions**: Consider implementing permission-based system for finer control

## Security Considerations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum required access
2. **Role Escalation Protection**: Cannot elevate own role
3. **Sensitive Data Protection**: Salary and personal data access controls
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all administrative actions
5. **Session Management**: Role-based session timeouts
